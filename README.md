# 🚲 London Bike Sharing Data Analysis

This project analyzes the London bike sharing dataset to explore demand patterns based on weather, season, and time variables.  
Additionally, probability concepts (Binomial, Poisson, and Normal distributions) are applied to solve real-world scenarios related to event probabilities.

Developed as part of the **Higher Diploma in Data Analytics (HDip) coursework**.
